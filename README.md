# Structural-Performance-Prediction-and-Feature-Analysis
A machine learning project for predicting structural performance parameters (Max Load, Max Deflection, Ductility Index) and identifying key input features that most influence these responses. The Project involves three models **Gradient Boosting–based chained regression Model**, **Artifical Neural Network (ANN) Model**, and **Feature Selection Model**

  ## Model Overview

- **Gradient Boosting–based chained regression Model** and **ANN Model** are **predictive models** developed to estimate:
  - **Max Load Carrying Capacity**
  - **Max Deflection**
  - **Ductility Index**

- The **Feature Selection Model** identifies the **most influential factors** (input parameters) affecting these performance metrics.

## ⚙️ Method Summary

- Dataset was preprocessed and normalized using `MinMaxScaler`.
- Models were trained and evaluated in **Google Colab** using Python libraries such as:
  - PyTorch  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Pandas, NumPy  
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn  
  - MLXtend  
- Performance metrics include **R²**, **RMSE**, and **MAE**.
- Visual outputs include correlation heatmaps and feature importance plots.
